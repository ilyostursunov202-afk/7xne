The AI engineer successfully progressed the e-commerce application through several stages of development and debugging. Initially, the engineer established the core e-commerce features (product browsing, cart, checkout) and integrated AI for product descriptions. Subsequently, the focus shifted to user accounts, multi-vendor support, and advanced features like PWA and an admin panel. Key challenges included fixing frontend routing, JavaScript compilation errors in  (a tricky issue resolved with a Babel dependency and yarn install v1.22.22

Done in 0.43s.), and most significantly, resolving cart persistence and wishlist state management. The root cause for cart issues was identified as double initialization due to React Strict Mode, which was fixed using a  hook. The engineer demonstrated systematic debugging by adding logs and leveraging testing agents to pinpoint and resolve issues. The work concluded with all previously reported broken features being fixed, and the application now fully functional with core e-commerce, authentication, admin, and PWA capabilities.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a multi-feature e-commerce platform similar to Uzum Market or AliExpress.
**Initial Core Requirements:** Main customer interface (home, search, categories, product details, cart, checkout), user registration/authentication (JWT/OAuth2), Admin Panel (product/user/order management, analytics), Seller Panel (product management, orders, sales), and a responsive design with payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal) and AI features.

**Prioritized Enhancements:** The initial focus was on the customer shopping experience and AI for product descriptions. Post-MVP, the user requested: User Accounts (profile, order history), Reviews & Ratings, Wishlist, Multi-Vendor Marketplace (seller onboarding, commissions), Order Tracking & Notifications, Coupons & Discounts, advanced AI (chat, dynamic pricing), Mobile Optimization (PWA), and Security & Scaling (RBAC, Docker/Kubernetes). The engineer was explicitly tasked with fixing broken basket/product pages, then implementing PWA and making the admin panel functional. Later, specific broken features like Search, Product Likes, Card Payment, and Add to Cart were identified for immediate fix.

**Directory Structure:**


-   :
    -   **Importance:** Core FastAPI application, defines API endpoints.
    -   **Changes:** Already contained product CRUD, search, Stripe, authentication, reviews, wishlists, multi-vendor, and coupon management. No major structural changes during this trajectory, mainly verification.
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Pydantic models for data validation and MongoDB schemas.
    -   **Changes:** Defined user, product, review, wishlist, cart, seller, coupon, notification models. No changes during this trajectory.
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Centralizes authentication (hashing, JWT). No changes during this trajectory.
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Main React component handling routing, global state (auth, cart, wishlist), and layout.
    -   **Changes:**

        -   Integrated AdminPanel component and its route.
        -   **Critical Fixes:**
            -   Resolved JavaScript compilation error by adding  dependency.
            -   Fixed  and  by preventing double cart initialization using  to track  execution.
            -   Fixed  by passing the entire  array to  and recalculating  inside, ensuring UI updates.
        -   Debug  statements were added and subsequently removed.
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Main HTML file, entry point for React app.
    -   **Changes:** Updated to include manifest link and service worker registration for PWA capabilities.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully resolved all previously reported broken functionalities.
**Current State of the Product:**
The e-commerce platform is now fully operational with the following core features verified and working:
-   **Customer-facing UI:** Homepage loads, products display with images and AI descriptions. Product detail page, shopping cart, and Stripe checkout are functional.
-   **Authentication:** User registration and login with JWT are fully functional. A default admin user ( / ) has been created and verified.
-   **Product Catalog:** Products can be added, viewed, edited, and deleted via the Admin Panel.
-   **Reviews & Wishlist:** Basic functionality for adding reviews and managing wishlists is implemented. Heart buttons on product cards now correctly update their state and items persist in the wishlist for logged-in users.
-   **Shopping Cart:** The Add to Cart button now works correctly. Cart items persist across page navigations, the cart badge in the header updates accurately, and the cart page displays the correct items and totals.
-   **Checkout Process:** The Proceed to Checkout button is now visible and the Stripe session creation is working successfully, allowing card payments.
-   **Admin Panel:** The  route is accessible to admin users. The Products tab within the Admin Panel now provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for products.
-   **PWA Capabilities:** Basic PWA elements like , ,  are in place, and the  has been updated for proper registration.
-   **Search Function:** Confirmed to be working as per previous testing.

**Nuances Present:**
-   Product images on the homepage may sometimes appear as gray placeholders, indicating a potential frontend rendering or image loading issue, though not critical for core functionality.
-   The critical fix for cart persistence involved identifying and resolving a React Strict Mode double-initialization issue using .
-   A JavaScript compilation error was encountered and resolved by installing a specific Babel plugin () using Yarn.

<optional_next_step>
Based on the pending tasks, the next logical step is to continue implementing PWA capabilities beyond the basic setup.
