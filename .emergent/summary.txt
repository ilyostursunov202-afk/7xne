The AI engineer successfully progressed the e-commerce application from a functional MVP to a more feature-rich platform. Initial efforts focused on debugging and stabilizing core features like cart persistence, wishlist, and authentication, along with PWA integration and making the admin panel fully functional. A critical JavaScript compilation error in  was resolved by adding a Babel dependency, and cart persistence issues were fixed using  to prevent double initialization. Subsequently, the engineer implemented user management and statistics, multi-language support (English/Russian), and comprehensive profile settings within the admin panel and user interface. The most recent significant work involved creating a dedicated catalog page with categories and enhanced search functionality. This required backend endpoints and frontend components for filtering and displaying products. The final stage initiated by the user requested an overhaul of the registration process to include phone/address, SMS verification, and a forgot password flow, which is currently in progress, having set up backend models and started frontend components.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a multi-feature e-commerce platform akin to Uzum Market or AliExpress, encompassing core customer features (browsing, cart, checkout), user authentication, admin and seller panels, and AI features for product descriptions. Key enhancements prioritized later included user accounts, reviews, wishlist, multi-vendor support, order tracking, coupons, advanced AI, PWA, and security.

Throughout the trajectory, specific feature development was requested:
1.  **Debugging & Stabilization**: Fix broken basket/product pages, search, product likes, card payment, and add-to-cart functionality.
2.  **Admin Panel Extension**: Add a user statistics page (total users, list with ID, name, email, role, registration date, status), user search/filter, block/unblock, and role changes. Also, view sales/orders/visits statistics and action logs.
3.  **Multi-language Support**: Implement a language switcher (English/Russian) using i18n or JSON files, saving user choice.
4.  **Profile Settings**: Allow users to edit name, email, password, and avatar with validation; upload/crop profile picture; save changes to DB and update UI live.
5.  **Catalog Page**: Create a separate catalog page  to display all categories (specifically electronics categories) and products.
6.  **Enhanced Search**: Improve the existing search bar with better functionality.
7.  **Registration & Password Reset**: Add phone number and delivery address to registration, require SMS/call verification for number, and implement a forgot password flow with email/number code verification.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully resolved all previously reported broken functionalities and significantly enhanced the application.

**Current State of the Product:**
The e-commerce platform is fully operational with core features like customer-facing UI (homepage, product details, cart, Stripe checkout), user authentication, product catalog management via the Admin Panel (CRUD operations), reviews, wishlist, and basic PWA capabilities. The search function is confirmed to be working.

**Recent Major Implementations:**
1.  **Admin Panel Enhancements**:
    *   **User Management**: The Admin Panel now includes a Users tab allowing administrators to view, search, filter, block/unblock users, and change user roles.
    *   **Statistics**: A Dashboard tab provides an overview of total users, products, sales, and orders.
    *   **Action Logging**: Backend endpoints for action logs are in place.
2.  **Multi-language Support**:
    *   A language switcher (EN/RU) is integrated into the header.
    *   Core UI elements and product descriptions now support translation.
3.  **Profile Settings**:
    *   Logged-in users can access a Profile Settings page to edit their name, email, password, and upload an avatar.
4.  **Catalog Page & Enhanced Search**:
    *   A dedicated  page has been created, displaying categorized products.
    *   Backend endpoints and a script () were used to populate the database with electronics categories and sample products.
    *   The search functionality in the header has been enhanced with auto-completion and suggestions, linking to the new catalog page for comprehensive search results.

**Nuances Present / Work in Progress:**
-   The Select.Item components within the catalog filters were causing frontend rendering errors. A temporary fix involved replacing them with basic lists to ensure functionality, but a more robust UI component might be needed for a polished user experience.
-   The current work involves implementing **enhanced user registration** (collecting phone and delivery address, SMS/call verification) and **password reset functionality**. Backend models and API endpoints for these features have been added, and the initial frontend components () are being developed. The integration with external SMS (Twilio) and Email (SendGrid) services has been planned, and API keys are awaited from the user.
