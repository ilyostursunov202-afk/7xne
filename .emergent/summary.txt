<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a multi-feature e-commerce platform in two major phases. The first phase focused on a core customer experience, including product display, search, shopping cart, and Stripe checkout, with AI integration for product descriptions. Key decisions involved using FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend, MongoDB as the database, and integrating Stripe for payments and GPT-4o for AI features. The UI leveraged Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components, adhering to strict design guidelines. The engineer demonstrated proactive debugging, fixing issues like blank search results and an empty product collection. The second phase, initiated by user request, started building out user accounts/authentication, multi-vendor support, coupons, and notifications. The work involved significant updates to backend models and routes, and a new  file. The trajectory ends as the engineer is implementing PWA capabilities, having just completed core backend setup for multi-vendor and coupon features, including testing user creation, admin coupon creation, and seller registration. The project has moved from MVP to comprehensive marketplace.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a major overhaul, integrating a robust authentication system, reviews, wishlists, and laying the groundwork for the multi-vendor marketplace, coupons, and notifications.

**Current State of the Product:**
The e-commerce platform is largely functional, including:
-   **Customer-facing UI:** A modern homepage displaying products with AI-generated descriptions and images. A functional product detail page, a shopping cart allowing quantity editing and item removal, and a working Stripe checkout process.
-   **Authentication:** Fully functional user registration and login with JWT. Users can sign up ( was registered) and log in, receiving a valid JWT access token.
-   **Product Catalog:** Products can be added via API (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro, MacBook Pro 16-inch) and are listed on the homepage.
-   **Reviews & Wishlist:** Basic functionality for adding reviews and adding products to a wishlist has been implemented and tested via API calls.
-   **Admin Panel (Product Management):** Basic CRUD operations for products are implemented and accessible via  route.
-   **Backend Enhancements:** Models for users, sellers, coupons, and notifications have been created. Core API endpoints for multi-vendor (seller registration, approval) and coupon management (creation by admin) are in place.

**Nuances Present:**
-   **Product Persistence:** Products initially added were lost during a restart, necessitating re-addition. This indicates a potential issue with database persistence or initial data seeding strategy during restarts.
-   **Role-Based Access:** The system correctly enforced permissions, preventing a non-admin user from creating coupons, which led to the creation of an explicit admin user for testing.
-   **Frontend Components:** Significant progress was made on the frontend, including new components for login/register modals, an enhanced header, product cards, product details, cart, checkout, and an admin panel. The  and  components were recently created.
-   **PWA Implementation:** The very last action in the trajectory () indicates the engineer is beginning to add PWA capabilities.

The immediate work before this summary request was creating the frontend components for the multi-vendor marketplace, specifically the , and then starting to add PWA capabilities.
